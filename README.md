# Coverage Navigator

Simple interface written in Python3 to interact with the NavigateCompleteCoverage action server and the rest od nav2. Not ready. Still Testing. Missing stuff

Only the coverage server is working at the moment. 

# TODO
Pretty much everything, still very early. 
 - write readme
 - integrate rest of navigation stack (at least gotopose)
 - clean up code
